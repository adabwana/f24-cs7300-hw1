We start with a hypothetical population of 100,000 to make our calculations more tangible.\n\n2. Given the disease rate of 2%, we calculate the number of people with and without the disease:\n\n\n$$\\text{With disease} = 100,000 \\times 0.02 = 2,000$$\n\n$$\\text{Without disease} = 100,000 - 2,000 = 98,000$$\n\n\n3. We then determine the number of true positives (people with the disease who test positive) and false positives (people without the disease who test positive):\n\n$$\\text{True positives} = 2,000 \\times 0.90 = 1,800$$\n\n$$\\text{False positives} = 98,000 \\times (1 - 0.95) = 4,900$$\n\n\n4. The total number of positive tests is the sum of true positives and false positives:\n\n$$\\text{Total positives} = 1,800 + 4,900 = 6,700$$\n\n\n5. Finally, we calculate the probability that a person who tested positive has the disease by dividing the number of true positives by the total number of positive tests:\n\n$$P(\\text{Disease}|\\text{Positive}) = \\frac{\\text{True positives}}{\\text{Total positives}} = \\frac{1,800}{6,700} \\approx 0.2687$$\n\n\nThis approach, reminiscent of Kahneman's 'Linda problem', demonstrates how our intuitions about probability can be misleading. Despite the high accuracy rates of the test, the low prevalence of the disease in the population significantly affects the final probability.\n\nIt's worth noting that this calculation assumes independence between test results and disease prevalence, which may not always hold in real-world scenarios. Factors such as test administration, population demographics, and environmental conditions could potentially influence these probabilities.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"background-color:grey;height:2px;width:100%;\"></div>\n```\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div></div>\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n<style></style><style>.printedClojure .sourceCode {\n  background-color: transparent;\n  border-style: none;\n}\n</style><style>.clay-limit-image-width .clay-image {max-width: 100%}\n.clay-side-by-side .sourceCode {margin: 0}\n.clay-side-by-side {margin: 1em 0}\n</style>\n<script src=\"assignments.hw1.q2_files/md-default0.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><script src=\"assignments.hw1.q2_files/md-default1.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><script src=\"assignments.hw1.q2_files/katex2.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.10/dist/katex.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\n\n::: {.sourceClojure}\n```clojure\n(ns assignments.hw1.q2\n  (:require\n   [assignments.hw1.utils :refer :all]\n   [fastmath.core :as m]))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2\n---\n\n#### *Q2: Probability Review (40 Points)*\n\n***Suppose a certain disease affects 2% of the population.
