However, the model performance was not satisfying based on initial experiments. To enhance the model's performance, he decided to add 50 more features, thinking that more data points would improve the model's accuracy. However, the opposite occurred: the model's accuracy decreased, the training process became slower, and the results became less reliable and harder to interpret. By looking into the details of the data, the scientist noticed three things:***\n\n- ***There were a lot of numerical features that vary significantly regarding values.***\n- ***The model was overfitting with too many features.***\n- ***The training process took much longer to converge (finish).***\n\n***Can you help the scientist identify the causes of the failure and propose some solutions?***\n\nThe data scientist's challenges stem from several key issues related to the nature of the features, model complexity, and data processing.\n\n***1. **Problem: Features with significant numerical variation*****\n\n***Cause:*** Features that vary significantly in magnitude can negatively impact many machine learning models, especially those that rely on distance metrics (e.g., linear models, SVMs). Some features may dominate others due to their scale, leading to biased results.\n  \n ***Solution:*** Apply feature scaling techniques like standardization (z-score normalization) or min-max normalization to ensure all features are on a similar scale. This will allow the model to weigh all features more equally.\n\n\n::: {.sourceClojure}\n```clojure\n(let [data (tc/dataset {:age [20 30 35 40 50]\n                        :income [30000 40000 59000 55000 90000]\n                        :credit-score [650 700 750 800 850]\n                        :z [-2 -1 0 1 2]})\n\n      normalized-data (apply-to-all-columns data normalize-column)]\n  (tc/dataset normalized-data))\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.clay-dataset}\n_unnamed [5 4]:\n\n|   :age | :income | :credit-score |     :z |\n|--------|---------|---------------|--------|\n|      0 |       0 |             0 |      0 |\n| 0.3333 |  0.1667 |        0.2500 | 0.2500 |\n| 0.5000 |  0.4833 |        0.5000 | 0.5000 |\n| 0.6667 |  0.4167 |        0.7500 | 0.7500 |\n|      1 |       1 |             1 |      1 |\n\n\n:::\n\n\n**I.
